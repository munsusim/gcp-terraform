# Quick start
1. Clone the policy library
   - https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/policy-library
2. Copy the sample IAM domain restriction constraint into the policies/constraints directory
   - cp samples/iam_service_accounts_only.yaml policies/constraints
3. Examine the constraint you copied by priting it to the terminal
   - cat policies/constraints/iam_service_accounts_only.yaml
   - Notice gserviceaccount.com at the bottom. This specifies that only members from the gserviceaccount.com domain can be present in an IAM policy.
4. To verify that the policy works as expected, create the following Terraform main.tf file in the current directory. You can use nano, vim, or the Cloud Shell Editor to create policy-library/main.tf
    terraform {
    required_providers {
        google = {
        source = "hashicorp/google"
        version = "~> 3.84"
        }
    }
    }

    resource "google_project_iam_binding" "sample_iam_binding" {
    project = "PROJECT_ID"
    role    = "roles/viewer"

    members = [
        "user:EMAIL_ADDRESS"
    ]
    }
5. Initialize Terraform and generate a Terraform plan using the following:
   - terraform init
6. Export the Terraform plan, if asked, click Authorize when prompted:
   - terraform plan -out=test.tfplan
7. Convert the Terraform plan to JSON:
   - terraform show -json ./test.tfplan > ./tfplan.json
8. Install the terraform-tools component:
   - sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk-terraform-tools
9. Enter the following command to validate that your Terraform plan complies with your policies:
   - gcloud beta terraform vet tfplan.json --policy-library=. --format=json
